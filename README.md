# Matlab_IC_Engine
Matlab code for an IC engine lab from 2021

This lab involved collecting data from an internal combustion engine. Sensors supplied the raw data and we used Excel and Matlab to clean, analyze, and visualize
the data.

Here is a link to the presentation we did covering the lab: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CW7eW2BWldWx7apgL2W2rxJUuTHTryCT
